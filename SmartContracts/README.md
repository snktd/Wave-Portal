# Wave portal

This project demonstrates a basic wave recording application on Web3. 

It includes:

- A smart contract to record the number of waves
- A run.js script that deploys the contract on local etherum network using Hardhat.
- A deploy.js script that can deploy the contract to Alchemy.
- React code to create a UI with the ability to record and display the wavers and timestamp.
